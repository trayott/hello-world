# hello-world
Getting to know Git

* not certain I like using an online editor.  Need to learn how to do this locally UPDATE: figured that one out because I updated this on my local machine with vi
* I've really got to get up on this so I'm in the loop with what we're doing with ICP UPDATE: ICP might not be our direction.  Just need to learn cloud from different service providers (AWS, Azure, IBM, Google, etc.)
* hopefully I haven't lost it yet UPDATE: Yea, you've lost it.
